## Current Interests and Projects:

I was always passionate about writing. After exploring the field as a freelance writer for several web portals I decided to delve deeper and signed up as a Graduate student of Technical Communication at the North Carolina State University, Raleigh. My background in education inspired me to convert complex pieces of information into easily understandable content. I haven't looked back since.
